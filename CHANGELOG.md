# Changelog

Notable changes to this preservation/modernization of **Sancho**.
Format loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

The upstream project's original changelog (2004–2006) is preserved at
[`appimage/usr/bin/distrib/ChangeLog`](appimage/usr/bin/distrib/ChangeLog). The
authentic early **0.9.4-23** source lives at the `0.9.4-23` tag
(`git checkout 0.9.4-23`).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Folded WebBrowserTab's and MenuBar's decompiled inner classes back into their parent
  files** (20 `WebBrowserTab$*.java` and 26 `MenuBar$*.java` fragments → nested/anonymous
  classes; 46 files gone). Purely structural: anonymous listeners are inlined at their
  call sites, named classes (`WebBrowserViewFrame`, the favorite `Action`s,
  `AlphaInputDialog`, `URLListener`) become nested classes, and the decompiler's
  `this$0`/`access$NNN` artifacts are removed. Loop-captured variables get an
  effectively-final copy where a listener needed it. MenuBar's structure was restored
  from the original `0.9.4-23` source as a template. No behaviour change; the first,
  opportunistic steps of the inner-class re-merge (see ToDo). WebBrowserTab verified
  against a live browser tab.

### Removed

- **The IRC client.** Sancho's built-in IRC window (server/channel console, channel-user
  list, connect dialog) was dropped, which removes the last unmaintained dependency:
  `pircbot:pircbot:1.5.0` (abandoned since ~2011, a parser for untrusted IRC server text).
  Deleted the `sancho.view.irc` package, the `IRCConsole` classes, the Tools → "IRC
  client" menu item, the IRC preference tabs (display colors + server/nick/channel), all
  `irc*` preference defaults, the IRC i18n keys across all 14 locales, and the `pircbot`
  Maven dependency. The uber-jar no longer bundles any pircbot/jibble classes. (The only
  remaining old dependency is Trove 2.1.0, which is stable, isolated, and pinned.)

## [0.9.4-74] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Size/rate numbers could intermittently corrupt or crash (data race).**
  `SwissArmy.calcStringSize` / `calcStringSizeGrouped` weren't `synchronized` yet shared
  the static `DecimalFormat` (`df000`/`df00`/`dfGrouped`) and `FieldPosition` with the
  already-synchronized `calcRate`/`percentToString`. The core reader thread formats sizes
  (shared-file totals, upload table) while the UI thread formats table columns, so the two
  raced on the non-thread-safe formatters → occasional `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
  from `DigitList` or garbled numbers. Both methods are now `synchronized` on the same
  monitor.
- **"Update Registry" on the File Extensions tab crashed.** `changedExtPrefs` looped over
  `registerLinks.length` (4) while indexing `registerExtensions` (length 1) →
  `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the ".torrent" option was left unchanged. Bounded
  by the array actually indexed.
- **A malformed line in the download log crashed the Download-Complete window.**
  `DownloadCompleteItem.parseLine` sliced with an unchecked `indexOf("|")` result; a
  truncated `ed2k://` line (`indexOf` → -1) threw `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The
  separators are now bounds-checked.
- **Chunk-image cache grew without bound.** The downloads tree cached a `ChunkImageData`
  per row in the label provider but the viewer pruned a different, never-populated field,
  so removed/finished downloads leaked their chunk buffers for the whole session. The
  prune now targets the real cache.
- **ETA-column sort was unstable** with two or more empty-ETA rows (`compare` violated
  antisymmetry — the case-8 fix pattern was missing here); empty ETAs now compare equal.
- **Robustness guards:** a null option value no longer NPEs the advanced-options page
  (`isBoolean(null)`); the network-stats label provider no longer NPEs on dispose before
  first render; the tray tooltip/restore paths null-check `trayItem` (consistent with the
  tray-less-platform fallback). Removed a stray decompiled `drawText("is the time", …)`
  from the download name column and a dead misspelled `useGraident` preference default;
  the chunk detail canvas now repaints on resize.

## [0.9.4-73] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Dialog buttons and the Preferences window stayed English.** Sancho's own dialogs
  labelled their buttons from JFace's English `IDialogConstants` (OK/Cancel/Yes/No), and
  the JFace `PreferenceDialog` supplied its own English title and OK/Cancel/Apply/Restore-
  Defaults labels — none of which follow Sancho's locale. All 17 dialog buttons now pull
  from `SResources` (`b.ok`/`b.cancel`/`b.yes`/`b.no`), and a `SanchoPreferenceDialog`
  subclass plus a `CPreferencePage` hook relabel the Preferences window's title and its
  OK/Cancel/Apply/Restore-Defaults buttons from `SResources` too. A handful of hardcoded
  status/error strings (IRC connect/disconnect titles, the web-browser-launch failure,
  the version-check-unavailable line, the link-ripper "Found links" label) were routed
  through `SResources` as well. The new keys are translated across all 14 bundled
  locales, and `es_ES` was completed to 100% of the current key set.
- **UI translations never loaded — the app was always English.** The 14 bundled
  translations (`sancho_<locale>.properties`) lived only in `appimage/usr/bin/distrib/`,
  which nothing ships: the Maven build bundled only the English base, and `SResources`
  looked for a translation solely in the user's home dir (`~/.sancho/`), where no build
  or installer step ever placed one. The translations now ship on the classpath inside
  the jar, and `SResources` resolves the chosen locale from there (with the English base
  as the per-key fallback and a `~/.sancho/sancho_<locale>.properties` still able to
  override). Language is driven strictly by the `locale` preference — an unset/unknown
  locale stays on the English base rather than following the OS locale. The language
  picker in Preferences → General now lists the locales bundled in the jar (plus any
  home-dir override) instead of scanning only the home dir, so it is no longer empty. The
  `es_ES` (Spanish) translation was completed to 100% of the current keys. The stale
  duplicates under `appimage/usr/bin/distrib/` were removed.
- **Windows Registry preference page tried to run `regedit.exe` off Windows.** In debug
  builds the page also shows on Linux/macOS (for UI preview), where its "Update Registry"
  button shelled `regedit.exe` — a Windows binary. The `updateRegistry` shell-out is now
  win32-guarded (off Windows it shows a "only supported on Windows" message instead), so
  the page stays previewable in debug but only touches the registry on Windows (unchanged
  for real Windows users).
- **Web browser: the address bar could show the wrong tab's URL.**
  `WebBrowserTab.inputCombo` was a single field pointing at the last-created tab, so
  with multiple browser tabs the URL was written to (and read from) that tab's combo
  instead of the selected one. Each combo is now bound to its `CTabItem` and every
  read/write resolves the right tab's combo.
- **Web browser: dropped non-ASCII URLs were mangled.**
  `UniformResourceLocator.nativeToJava` decoded the dropped bytes with the JVM default
  charset (UTF-8 since JDK 18). It now decodes the Windows shell `UniformResourceLocator`
  format as `windows-1252` and the Gecko `text/x-moz-url-data` format as UTF-16LE (the
  latter was also being truncated to one character by a scan-to-first-NUL).

### Removed

- **Web browser: dead "grab page as .torrent" Ctrl+click path.** `ctrlDown()` was
  hard-wired to `false` and `setupCtrlKey()` was an empty method with no callers, so the
  Ctrl branch never ran; SWT doesn't reliably deliver key events over a native browser
  control, so the feature can't be resurrected as designed. Removed the dead methods and
  the unreachable branch.

## [0.9.4-72] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Client-stats network list could be misparsed (proto ≥ 18).**
  `ClientStats18.readNetworks` read the per-network "connected servers" count only
  when the network id was already registered, but that `int32` is always on the wire —
  so an unknown id (common during startup/reconnect, before the matching
  `Network_info` arrives) left the count unread and every remaining entry in that
  stats tick was parsed one field out of alignment. Both fields are now read
  unconditionally. Self-healed on the next tick before, but showed wrong per-network
  server counts meanwhile.
- **Preview `Range` header could crash with an off-by-one.** `File.getContentRange` /
  `SharedFile.getContentRange` guarded the subfile index with `<= length` then indexed
  `[index]`, throwing `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the index equalled the
  subfile count. Changed to `< length`.
- **System tray crashed startup on tray-less Linux (GNOME/Wayland).**
  `Display.getSystemTray()` returns `null` on platforms `hasTray()` still green-lights,
  and `new TrayItem(null, 0)` throws `ERROR_NULL_ARGUMENT` — the old `trayItem == null`
  guard was dead code (a constructor never returns null), so the app died with no
  window. It now checks the actual tray and falls back to plain window minimize.
  (Windows always has a tray, so it was never hit there.)
- **Tray context menu leaked a native `Menu` on every right-click.** `MinimizerTray`
  called `MenuManager.createContextMenu` per `MenuDetect`, minting a fresh menu each
  time; it's now built once and reused (the listener still rebuilds the items on show).
  The tray icon is also disposed on shutdown.
- **File preview crashed on Linux/macOS.** `File.repSep` normalised path separators via
  `SwissArmy.replaceAll`, which compiles its "from" argument as a regex — a lone `"\\"`
  threw `PatternSyntaxException` and then NPE'd on `/`-separator platforms. Switched to
  literal `String.replace`.
- **Keyboard shortcuts now use the platform modifier (macOS ⌘).** Ctrl+A/Ctrl+F/Ctrl+T
  and the tab/link accelerators hardcoded the Ctrl bit; they use `SWT.MOD1` now
  (unchanged on Windows/Linux, Command on macOS).
- **`MessageEncoder.toBytes(Long)`** still used the signed `% / /= 256` division that was
  already fixed for `Short`/`Integer`; a uint64 with bit 63 set serialised only its low
  byte. Switched to bit-shift. (Latent — no current message sends a `Long`.)
- **Browser tab title could throw and stop updating.** The `TitleListener`
  dereferenced the `CTabItem` before its own null check; the Edge/WebView2 backend can
  fire a title event before the tab data is set, causing an NPE (and the title/label
  froze). It now null-checks first.
- **Dragging a link/text that offered only "copy" did nothing.** Three drop targets
  (browser URL combo, the `createLinkDropTarget` helper, the link-ripper field) forced
  `DROP_LINK`, which SWT rejects when the source only advertises `DROP_COPY`, so the
  drop was silently discarded. They now honour the offered operations.
- **Keypad Enter in the browser address bar** was compared against `character` (always
  false) instead of `keyCode`; corrected (was harmless — the normal Enter clause
  already covered it).
- **Cancelling a preview transfer froze the GUI up to 4 s.** `TransferDialog.close()`
  busy-waited on the UI thread for the download thread to acknowledge the cancel; it
  now just signals cancel and closes (the download thread stops on its next chunk and
  only touches widgets through disposed-guarded callbacks).
- **Adding a local `.torrent` froze the GUI ~1 s per file.** `SwissArmy.sendLocalTorrent`
  slept a second on the UI thread after the send was already flushed; removed.
- **A server added on a high port (32768–65535) was sent the wrong port.**
  `MessageEncoder.toBytes(Short)` used signed `/ 256` division, which mangled the high
  byte for ports that narrow to a negative `short`; it now extracts the bytes bitwise.
- **"Edit MP3 tags" and the shared-file detail dialog didn't respond to Enter** (no
  default button); OK is now the default in both.
- **The GUI froze for up to 3 s on an incoming friend message.** `FriendsTab`
  resolved the sender with a retry loop that `Thread.sleep`s up to 3× — and it ran
  inside the UI-thread runnable, freezing the whole GUI when the message came from a
  not-yet-collected client. The resolution (with its sleep) now runs on the core
  thread and only the UI append is marshalled.
- **"Add Friend" dialog didn't submit on Enter** (its hand-rolled button bar set no
  default button); OK is now the default.
- **Closing an IRC channel during traffic could throw "Widget is disposed".** The
  coloured-message runnable (`IRCConsole`) guarded the append but not the styling
  that followed; it now returns early if the console is disposed.
- **IRC voice/devoice was broken.** `CUser.voice()` compared for `@` twice (so a
  user could be voiced twice → `++nick`), and `deVoice()` used `>= 1` where the
  voiced prefix `+` is at index 0, so `-v` never removed the voice. Both corrected.
- **"Core Verbosity" dialog discarded changes on Enter.** Cancel was the default
  button (same bug as the IRC Connect dialog), so pressing Enter cancelled instead of
  applying the ticked verbosity keywords. OK is now the default.
- **The "Update stats tables delay" preference did nothing.** Its editor wrote to a
  dead key (`statsUpdateDelay`) while the core reads `statsDelay`, so the setting
  never took effect (and showed 0 instead of the 600 s default). The editor now uses
  the correct key.
- **Splash progress guarded against an out-of-range index** (`on[]` is shorter than
  `boxes[]`), avoiding a possible `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds`.
- **Base64 broke on inputs over 127 bytes.** `Base64.encode`/`decode` used `byte`
  loop counters and a `byte` output index that overflowed past 127, crashing (array
  index out of bounds) on larger data — e.g. HTTP Basic-auth credentials or a long
  preference key. Now use `int`.
- **Statistics graph-history window hung the UI.** `GraphHistory` drew the vertical
  grid with a `byte` loop counter that overflowed past 127 (120 + 20 → −116), so the
  loop never ended once the window was ≥128 px wide — an infinite loop in the paint
  handler that froze Sancho. Counter is now an `int`.
- **First paint of a statistics graph could throw.** `GraphCanvas.paintControl`
  assumed `controlResized` always ran before the first paint (only that set
  `needNewBuffer`); on modern SWT it may not, leaving `imageBuffer` null and
  `new GC(null)` throwing. It now also builds the buffer when it's null.
- **Downloads/Transfers tree could show stale rows after sorting/filtering** — the
  same virtual-viewer gap fixed for tables in 0.9.4-71, found by auditing the
  sibling `CustomTreeViewer`. Its `myClear` relied on SWT lazy `SetData` re-firing
  (unreliable on modern SWT/JFace), so top-level rows could keep pre-sort content.
  It now explicitly renders the visible top-level rows from the freshly-sorted
  content provider, mirroring the table fix.

## [0.9.4-71] — 2026-07-18

### Added

- **IRC server field in the "Connect to IRC?" dialog.** You can now set the server
  (pref `ircServer`) there alongside the nickname and channel, instead of only in
  Preferences.

### Fixed

- **Tables showed stale/duplicated rows and some rows ignored sorting.** The custom
  virtual-table viewer never rendered rows that SWT asked for lazily — its
  `ILazyContentProvider.updateElement(int)` was empty and a never-rendered row had no
  item mapping, so the positional-diff refresh could never repaint it. Rows (often
  the top ones) kept stale content and "stuck" when sorting/filtering; the same
  element could appear in two rows. The Servers "Connected" view was the most
  visible case (it showed wrong servers). Fixed by implementing the lazy
  `updateElement(int)`, explicitly rendering the visible rows from the freshly
  sorted content in `myClear`, and restoring the stale-item disassociation guard in
  `replace` (which the sibling `CustomTreeViewer` still had). Affects every virtual
  table (transfers, servers, uploads, search results, …). Diagnosed with runtime
  logging against a live core.
- **IRC rejected nicknames with accents/ñ** ("432 Erroneous Nickname"). The nickname
  is now sanitized before connecting — accents are decomposed (ñ→n, á→a) and only
  IRC-legal characters are kept — so a configured nick like `pruebañ…` connects as
  `prueban…` instead of failing.
- **"Connect to IRC?" dialog cancelled on Enter.** Cancel was the default button, so
  pressing Enter after editing a field cancelled instead of accepting. OK is now the
  default button, and the edited nick/channel are only saved on OK (Cancel discards
  them).

## [0.9.4-70] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Core would not start from a path with spaces** (e.g. `C:\Program Files\…`).
  `ExecConsole` used the single-string `Runtime.exec`, which splits on whitespace;
  it now uses the `String[]` form (and tolerates a null parent dir).
- **External links were dead on modern Linux.** The GTK path spawned
  `mozilla`/`konqueror`/`netscape` (none of which exist today). It now opens links
  via SWT's `Program.launch` (xdg-open/gio), falling back to `xdg-open` and then the
  legacy chain, while still honouring an explicitly configured browser.
- **Sorting could crash with "Comparison method violates its general contract".**
  Three comparators were not antisymmetric for equal elements — `Addr` (two
  firewalled peers), client State (two downloading clients), and the downloads tree
  Rate/State column (files sharing a state). All now return a consistent order, so
  sorting those columns no longer throws on TimSort.
- **Integers with the high bit set were corrupted on the wire.**
  `MessageEncoder` masked the top byte with `0x7FFFFFFF`, dropping bit 31; large
  ids / IP-as-int values sent to the core are now encoded correctly.
- **A malformed chunk-age token from the core broke the read loop.**
  `File.readChunkAges` now guards `Integer.parseInt` (like its sibling `readAge`)
  and defaults to 0 instead of throwing out of the socket message stream.
- **Size filters in "TB" evaluated to 0 bytes.** `SwissArmy.stringSizeToLong` used
  an `int` multiplier, so 2^40 overflowed to 0; it now uses a `long` (and `double`
  arithmetic for precision).
- **Core strings decoded with the JVM default charset** rendered differently across
  JDK 17 vs 18+ (mojibake on non-ASCII filenames/nicknames). `MessageBuffer` now
  decodes them as explicit UTF-8.
- **GDI handle leak browsing search results.** The result tooltip allocated a new
  `Region` on every hover without disposing the previous one; it is now disposed on
  each reposition and on teardown.
- **Native bitmap leak on every screenshot.** Tools → Screenshot never disposed the
  window-sized `Image` (on save or cancel); it is now disposed in a `finally`.
- **False "new version" popup from the dead update host.** The version check now
  validates that the fetched string looks like a version before showing the
  "latest version" text / popup, avoiding a bogus prompt (and a null-line NPE).
- **Minor robustness/leak cleanups.** `Console` now disposes its hand `Cursor`
  (leaked one handle per console); `GSorter.compareInts` uses `Integer.compare`
  (no subtraction overflow) and the string tie-break honours the working sort
  direction; `MessageBuffer.getString` bounds-checks the length field before
  decoding (a malformed length no longer throws out of the read loop); and the
  debug `hexDump`/`getLastMessage` no longer drop the last byte or wrap the offset
  label.
- **Core reader thread no longer blocks on the UI thread.** The `MainWindow`,
  `FriendsTab` and `GTreeContentProvider` observer callbacks used `Display.syncExec`
  from the socket reader thread (a potential deadlock); they now use `asyncExec`
  like the other content providers.
- **Removed the dead Windows 95/98/ME detection.** `VersionInfo.isWin95` /
  `isOldWindows` / `oldWindows` never matched a modern `os.version`, so the legacy
  small-icon and emulated-spinner branches were unreachable; dropped them (`BSpinner`
  now always uses the native SWT `Spinner`).

### Changed

- **Regexes now use `java.util.regex` directly.** The thin `sancho.utility.regex`
  adapter (`RE`/`REMatch`/`REException`) kept when `gnu-regexp` was dropped is gone;
  its 13 call sites were rewritten to `Pattern`/`Matcher`/`PatternSyntaxException`
  (a 1:1, behaviour-preserving mapping — exactly-one-match and null-input semantics
  kept). Verified the link/bookmark/env-var parsing conversions and a full build.
- **Table sort tolerance no longer needs a global JVM flag.** `GSorter` now sorts
  with its own stable merge sort, which tolerates the live model data being mutated
  by the core thread mid-sort (the reason a plain `Arrays.sort`/TimSort threw
  "Comparison method violates its general contract"). The
  `-Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true` flag was therefore removed from the
  launcher, `build-app.ps1` and the VS Code launch config. Validated the merge sort
  against `Arrays.sort` (order + stability) and confirmed it tolerates an
  inconsistent comparator without throwing.
- **Dropped the deprecated-for-removal boxing constructors.** Replaced all 77
  `new Integer(…)` / `new Short(…)` / `new Byte(…)` calls (inherited from the
  decompiled source) with the `valueOf(…)` factory methods, which are the
  non-deprecated, allocation-free form. No behavioural change — these values are
  used as core message payloads and `HashMap` keys, both compared by `equals`.

## [0.9.4-69] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **Navigation toolbar invisible at startup.** The main window laid out only the
  inner CoolBar composite, so the outer `GridLayout` gave the toolbar row no height
  until the first manual resize (the button bar under the menu was intermittently
  missing on launch). It now forces a full `shell.layout(true, true)` once the
  window is open at its restored size.
- **Displayed version stuck at `0.9.4-59`.** `VersionInfo` had the number baked in
  from the decompiled source; it now reads the real build version, filtered in from
  `${project.version}` via a `version.properties` resource (falls back to
  `0.9.4-dev` when run from unbuilt sources).

### Changed

- **Embedded web browser now uses Edge on Windows.** With the old Mozilla/XULRunner
  backend gone, the browser defaulted to the legacy Internet Explorer engine
  (`SWT.NONE`) on Windows. It now creates the modern Edge/Chromium (WebView2)
  browser by default, falling back to the platform default if WebView2 is
  unavailable. The obsolete **"Force mozilla"** preference and its wiring were
  removed.

## [0.9.4-68] — 2026-07-18

### Changed

- **Cleaner build output.** The uber-jar no longer emits maven-shade
  "overlapping resource" warnings — the duplicate Eclipse/OSGi build metadata
  (`.options`, `.api_description`, `about.html`, `about_files/**`,
  `plugin.properties`) and the per-jar `MANIFEST.MF` are excluded, and the
  manifest is regenerated with the `Main-Class`. The vendored JFace in
  `local-repo/` now ships `.sha1`/`.md5` checksums (and `unsign-libs.ps1`
  writes them) so Maven stops warning about missing checksums. Only the upstream
  SWT `${osgi.platform}` POM warning (from Eclipse's own artifact) remains.

### Fixed

- **Release runs are serialized** with a `concurrency` group, so moving a tag to
  re-release cancels the in-flight run instead of leaving two runs deleting,
  recreating and uploading to the same GitHub Release at once.

### Docs

- README: dropped the stale **GNU RegExp** dependency mention (it was removed in
  0.9.4-64).

## [0.9.4-67] — 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Windows `.msi` installer.** Releases now ship `sancho-<ver>-win64.msi` (WiX 3
  via jpackage) next to the portable zip: it installs to Program Files with
  Start-menu / desktop shortcuts and a stable upgrade code (new versions replace
  old ones). The setup dialog has an opt-out checkbox to register the `.torrent`
  file type and the `ed2k` / `magnet` / `sig2dat` URL protocols under
  `HKLM\Software\Classes` (command `"…\sancho.exe" "-l" "%1"`, matching the app's
  own Windows-registry page). Silent installs control it with the public
  `REGISTERASSOC` property (`msiexec /i … /qn REGISTERASSOC=0`).

## [0.9.4-66] — 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- **macOS external links**: `WebLauncher` keyed the native `/usr/bin/open` on the
  removed `carbon` SWT platform, so modern macOS (`cocoa`) fell through to the
  generic path. It now handles `cocoa` too.

### Changed

- Platform-code audit: removed dead checks for long-gone SWT platforms
  (`motif` in the tray icon; `carbon` for the sort-indicator default) and skip the
  extra table mouse listener on `cocoa` as well (matching the old `carbon` intent).

### Build & tooling

- Added **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`): weekly updates for GitHub
  Actions and Maven dependencies/plugins, ignoring the compatibility-pinned ones
  (Eclipse SWT — coupled to the vendored unsigned JFace — and Trove major).

## [0.9.4-65] — 2026-07-18

### Build & tooling

- CI: the Release workflow no longer uses `actions/upload-artifact` /
  `download-artifact` (which still forced the deprecated Node 20). A
  `prepare-release` job creates the Release, then each platform job uploads its
  packages straight into it with `gh release upload`. No more Node 20 warnings.

## [0.9.4-64] — 2026-07-18

### Changed

- Dropped the abandoned **`gnu-regexp:1.1.4`** (~2001) dependency. Regexes now run
  on the JDK's `java.util.regex`, behind a thin `sancho.utility.regex` adapter
  (`RE` / `REMatch` / `REException`) so the ~24 call sites only needed their
  imports changed. All patterns — including the `ed2k` / `magnet` / `.torrent`
  link parsing — were verified to compile and match under `java.util.regex`.

### Build & tooling

- CI: bump `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` to v5
  (Node 24) to clear the Node 20 deprecation warning in the Release workflow.

## [0.9.4-63] — 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Self-contained runnable uber-jar.** `mvn package` also produces
  `sancho-<version>-all.jar` (maven-shade-plugin, jar signatures and duplicate
  `module-info` stripped) that bundles every dependency, so it runs with just
  `java -jar`. Releases now ship a per-platform uber-jar
  (`sancho-<ver>-<platform>.jar`) alongside the native packages, replacing the
  old classpath-only thin jar.

### Build & tooling

- CI: the **Build** check is now a single lightweight Linux compile (the full
  multi-OS packaging runs in **Release**) and skips `Release …` commits, so a
  release push no longer runs two overlapping workflows at once.

## [0.9.4-62] — 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Cross-platform build (Linux / macOS / Windows).** The pom now auto-selects the
  stock SWT fragment for the build machine via OS/arch profiles
  (`win32`, `gtk.linux.x86_64/aarch64`, `cocoa.macosx.x86_64/aarch64`); override
  with `-Dswt.artifactId=…`. The CI **Build** workflow runs on a
  Linux/Windows/macOS matrix.
- **Cross-platform release artifacts.** The release workflow is now a
  Windows/Linux/macOS matrix that publishes, in one Release: the Windows portable
  `.zip` + jar, Linux `.deb` + `.rpm`, and a macOS `.dmg`. `build-exe.ps1` became
  the cross-platform `tools/build-app.ps1 -Type <app-image|deb|rpm|dmg>`.

### Changed

- Only **JFace** is now signature-stripped (it is platform-independent); SWT is
  used stock/signed per platform, decoupled from the unsigned-JFace artifact.
  `tools/unsign-libs.ps1` and `local-repo/` updated accordingly.

## [0.9.4-61] — 2026-07-17

### Changed

- Replaced the abandoned **`com.jcraft:jsch:0.1.55`** with the maintained fork
  **`com.github.mwiede:jsch:0.2.23`** (same `com.jcraft.jsch` package, so a
  drop-in), which carries security fixes and modern algorithms.

### Build & tooling

- Added a **Build** workflow ([`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml))
  that compiles and packages on every push and pull request to `main`, so
  regressions surface before a release tag is cut. Added build and release
  badges to the README.

## [0.9.4-60] — 2026-07-17

First versioned release of the modernized build. `sancho-src/src` is the
**0.9.4-59** source recovered by decompiling the last published binary (the
authentic source was lost), ported to build and run on a current JDK, plus bug
fixes found in review.

### Build & tooling

- **Maven build** (`pom.xml`) targeting **SWT 3.124 / JFace 3.31 on JDK 17+**;
  produces `sancho-0.9.4-60.jar`.
- **VS Code** config ([`.vscode/`](.vscode)) with a ready "Sancho (GUI)" run
  configuration (F5) including the required VM args.
- **Windows portable executable** via `jpackage`
  (`tools/build-exe.ps1`, later renamed): `sancho.exe` with a bundled Java
  runtime. The launcher is named/started so the app's built-in
  *Preferences → Windows registry* page wires `.torrent` / `ed2k:` double-click to
  the core.
- **GitHub Actions release** ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)):
  tag a commit → build the jar + exe → publish a GitHub Release.
- Signature-stripped SWT/JFace in a project-local Maven repo
  ([`local-repo/`](local-repo)) so Sancho's vendored `org.eclipse.jface.viewers`
  classes load into the (otherwise signed) package; regenerate with
  [`tools/unsign-libs.ps1`](tools/unsign-libs.ps1).

### Source recovery & port (from 0.9.4-59)

- Decompiled with **Vineflower** (flat classes, synthetics kept, generics off) so
  the output recompiles.
- Ported the 2008-era code to modern SWT/JFace: stubbed the GCJ-only `Prov`
  bootstrap; used reflection for `MenuManager` / `FieldEditorPreferencePage`
  private members; delegated the custom viewers' `preservingSelection` to the
  modern base; UTF-8 sources; added casts where raw collections lost their element
  types; 32→64-bit COM handles.

### Fixed

- **Win32 web browser tab** was broken on 64-bit SWT — its `COMObject` callbacks
  were declared `int method(int[])` and no longer override modern SWT's
  `long method(long[])`. The web tab now uses the standard `Browser` widget, which
  supports win32 natively. Removed the dead `WebBrowserTab_win32` /
  `LinkEntryItem_win32` code.
- **Browser engine**: replaced the removed `SWT.MOZILLA` style with **`SWT.EDGE`**
  (Chromium/WebView2) on Windows.
- **Table sorting crash**: the sorters compare live model data that the core
  mutates during a sort, so modern Java's TimSort throws *"Comparison method
  violates its general contract"*. Requested the legacy merge sort in `main()` so a
  plain `java -jar` survives too (not only the exe / VS Code launch config).
- **Preference icons**: restored the preference-tree node icons (modern JFace
  dropped the `PreferenceNode(id, page, imageDescriptor)` constructor) via a small
  `ImagePreferenceNode`.

### Known limitations

- This is **decompiled code**, not the authentic 0.9.4-59 source (lost): no
  original comments or local-variable names.
- The GCJ-only `Prov` provider bootstrap is a no-op stub (irrelevant on a stock
  JVM).
- The SWT Mozilla/XULRunner backend is gone; the legacy `forceMozilla` preference
  now maps to Edge on Windows.
- Cell editing and preference icons are implemented per modern JFace behavior but
  were only verified to build and launch, not click-tested in a live session.
