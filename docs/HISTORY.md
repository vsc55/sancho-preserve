## 6.1 Provenance

`sancho-src/src` on `main` is **not** authentic source. It was recovered by decompiling the last
published `0.9.4-59` binary (Vineflower) and then ported to modern SWT/JFace. It includes features that
were recovered by decompilation with no preserved authentic source (web browser, network stats, file
comments; the decompiled IRC client was later removed). For the genuine early source, use the
`0.9.4-23` tag.

**Reconstruction caveats:**

- The GCJ-only `Prov` bootstrap is a no-op stub.
- `MyMenuManager` / dynamic field-editor clearing use reflection over JFace internals.
- The removed SWT Mozilla backend is mapped to Edge on Windows.

## 6.2 Version lineage

Sancho used a `0.9.4-NN` snapshot scheme, later switched to plain-incrementing versions
(`0.9.5`, `0.9.6`, …). `main` always holds the newest modernized build.
